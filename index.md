# Hello World

This is my home page! My name is Matthew Lim and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Cybersecurity.

### CPSC 120

* Lab 3
    
    Being one of the first labs of the class, and also among my first formal experiences with coding, it is obvious why lab 3 will be listed as one of my favorites. This lab was also longer and somewhat more complex than the previous ones, making it one of the more memorable among the first few labs. Furthermore, part 1 of the lab was one way the class demonstrated how computer science could be used practically by making it so that we could automate simple tasks (Part 1 had us create code which would calculate the unit price of a pizza). Although the program itself was very simple, it introduced and enforced the very basics of coding we had learned in the lectures and readings. It had us incorporate operators and operations (as well as their underlying principles), which would be useful for problems involving mathematics. 

* Lab 7
    
    Lab 7 part 2 built upon a previous lab: Lab 5 part 1. Both labs were focused on a game called blackjack. My interest in this lab arose from the lab building upon the principles of a game I found interesting and upon code we had previously used to incorporate more functionality. The lab had us create code which would run a game of blackjack. The code needed at least two command line arguments (and there was to be no limit on the number of commands allowed - unlike lab 5). We were to calculate the amount the cards added up to, determining whether a player would or would not ‘bust’ with a given set of cards. To do this, we would make use of for loops, if statements, bools, and other tactics.

* Lab 12
    
    Lab 12, the last lab of the class, was also very interesting. It had us create functions that would output a gif, instead of just some variables or words. This, alone, made it one of my favorite labs. Out of the two parts included within the lab, part 1 was more likable for me because it created a more visually appealing gif. This part had us create a looping gif, which would have colored frames cycle to make it look as if the whole thing was moving. Although it was rather difficult, with us having to learn and implement a mathematical function incorporating sin (which included linking the library we get it from) as well as making use of the previous lessons learned in the class (vectors, iostream, loops and many more).
